# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Getting Started

### Python and Flask

Python 3.6 or higher installed

To run this Flask application:

In a terminal window, navigate into the directory that you forked.

Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt in your terminal window to make sure that all of the necessary Python packages (Flask and Flask-SocketIO, for instance) are installed.
Set the environment variable FLASK_APP to be application.py. On a Mac or on Linux, the command to do this is export FLASK_APP=application.py. On Windows, the command is instead set FLASK_APP=application.py.
Run flask run to start up your Flask application.

If you navigate to the URL provided by flask, you should see the home page!
